Graph Algorithms Application

•	Situation: There was a need to develop a Java application for processing and analyzing graph data, including edge cases.

•	Task: Implement key graph algorithms to compute Minimum Spanning Trees and assess connectivity in both connected and disconnected graphs.

•	Action: Developed the application to read graph edge data from files, applied Kruskal’s algorithm for MSTs in connected graphs, and used DFS for connectivity checks.
For disconnected graphs, computed MSTs for individual components.

•	Result: Delivered a Java application that effectively analyzes graph data, computes MSTs, and assesses connectivity.
